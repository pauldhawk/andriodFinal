 #  Read to Me
Paul Hawk

The App, Read to Me, allows children to hear books read to them by loved ones. There are so many ways loved ones can communicate but for children who cannot read it is more difficulty. A  fun way to bridge the gap is the app. My kids love it and they used the swiping to change the pages without even being told. 

## Features. 
*Alternate Images / Layouts for different screen sizes*: Because kids can’t read I did not use fragments creating a list view / activity. Instead I opted I used alternative images / layouts to try to give the best possible layout for the different phones. 

*Gestures* – The Reading activity incorporates swiping to change the pages. This feature is very user intuitive and fits perfect in the activity.  

*Media Playing*: (Partially implemented) In the Reading activity Audio is played for each page. The Recording activity is close to working but not fully implemented. 

*Data Persistence* (almost Implemented):
